# MLOps-with-MLflow
In this project, I aim at developing an end-to-end Machine Learning project, from problem formulation to model deployment and monitoring in production environment. MLflow will be utilized for experiment tracking and model registry managment, for containerization of the model, Docker will be utilizied. A machine learning model goes throgh different phases in its lifecycle from requirements elicitation to monitoring in production. There are varius industry standarts describing the exact phases and their outcomes, such as CRIISP-DM, Microsft Team Data Science Process and etc. Nonetheless, a typical machine learning process involves business understanding, requiremnts eliciation, explorotary data analysis, data transformation, feature engineering, modeling, experiment tracking, evaluation, productionaizing, and at last monitoring and continuos improvements.
